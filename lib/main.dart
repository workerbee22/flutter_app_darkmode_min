/// Flutter Dark Mode Min
///
/// Based on the default Flutter project, this is a basic example app to show light/dark mode operation
/// on Android, iOS/iPadOS, macOS and Windows 10 can be implemented.
/// Only two lines of code have been changed from the Flutter default project and yet this enables automatic
/// setting of a light or dark theme in the app, based on changes coming from the Android or iOS operating system
/// (rather than a manual switch within the app). When the theme is changed, the app state is retained and not lost
/// when the theme changes.
/// It relies on the MaterialApp() widget properties of [theme], [darkTheme] and [themeMode] properties. Support
/// for light and dark mode for Flutter was introduced in February 2019. See the key article here:
/// https://medium.com/flutter/android-dark-theme-in-flutter-9c8070b8b127
/// Themes are provided by the default theme data of ThemeData.light() or ThemeData.dark(). Colors for both light and
/// dark themes come from these two default theme data that Flutter provides.
///
/// Note: When the theme is changed on a device, you may get a warning about 'FloatingActionButtons using ThemeData
/// .accentIconTheme has been deprecated'. This is a framework warning as part of changes to Flutter theming and can
/// be ignored, it will be removed in future versions of Flutter.
